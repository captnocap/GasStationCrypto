# GasStationCrypto
The Crypto Gas Station.
Abstract;
This is a conceptual project where our token is reflecting gas to holders, ensuring they will never face issues with being short for a transaction again. We will use fees gathered from the token tax to build a cross-chain bridge for token holders to use for free. The income generated from the bridge by use of non-token holders will be used to buy back the native token and sent to a dead wallet. Over time this should radically deflate the native token circulating supply, rewarding token holders with an increase in value and increase in reflected gas.
